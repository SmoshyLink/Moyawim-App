# Moyawim

This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering course at AUB in the Spring of 2019-20.

## About

Moyawim (Later renamed to Ideally) provides a platform for typical users to find short-term freelance work. It allows employers to post job opportunities, then choose the best suited candidate from a list of applicants. 

This app was developed in Flutter/Dart, and utilizes Firebase's Authentication, Firestore, and Storage services.

This project was selected to be presented at the CMPS project day, and was nominated for the best project for CMPS 253.
